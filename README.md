### What you can do 

The application gives the possibility to generate some piano sounds just by **clicking on the notes** in the interface.

You can follow the available notes for the "Happy Birthday To You" song to test the piano. In addition, it is also possible to listen to this song using some speed levels (1-50).

### About the song "Happy Birthday To You"

This project was made with the intention of exploring some sound resources offered by Tone.js. Thus, the music chosen was very simple, but the process showed the great number of possibilities that can be created.

_The track that the user hears when playing the song is not a mp3._

In fact, it was generated using note by note, setting the rhythm according to a sheet music and thus providing a large number of options to change the speed at which the music is played.

**As a curiosity the names used to set rythms are exactly the ones used in the sheet musics, like minim (1/2) and crotchet (1/4)!**

**You can explore all the music construction logic used with Tone.js going to the _src/tone_ directory.**

### The piano interface

The piano created was basically made using CSS/SASS.
The sound is emitted when the user clicks on the key, generating an effect to highlight the action.
